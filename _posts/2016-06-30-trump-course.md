For the past few months, I have been widely quoted in the media about the incredible learning opportunity created by the "deviant" nature of the Trump campaign. 

Please see the Politico article at http://politi.co/1Sg6pmG 

The Donald offers us all lessons regarding tradeoffs amongst the roles of institutions, constraints, charisma, personality, and the media. 

Please see my recent TV appearance at http://bit.ly/27vzfpY 

I have prepared a syllabus (copy attached in the zip file at http://emergence.org/TrumpCourse.zip) which lends itself to both undergraduate and graduate courses, and it can easily be adapted for use in a night/weekend executive education course. Please note this is a course about pragmatic lessons to be learned from the Trump campaign and is not a historical/philosophical critique such as the hypothetical course suggested this week in the Chronicle of Higher Education (see http://bit.ly/28NffGj)

I realize that the timing is late. But, your students may have a real interest in pursuing such a timely topic - and I can promise you that the pursuit will be rigorous not surface. I am in the midst of finishing a book on America's unfortunate addiction to simplification and the presidential campaign offers significant fodder for theoretical reflection. (Sample chapter attached in the zip file.) 

I hope you will consider both how such a course on "Trump Studies" could be beneficial and that I should be the one to teach it. 

Attachments including my c.v and the syllabus can be found at http://emergence.org/TrumpCourse.zip

Examples of my teaching and speaking can be found at http://bit.ly/293FJDd 

I have great flexibility regarding the specific timing of the course offering. 

I look forward to chatting with you about a Trump Studies course and can be reached at lissack@isce.edu or 617-710-9565\.
